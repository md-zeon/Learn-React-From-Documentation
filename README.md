# 📘 Learn React from Documentation

Welcome to my **Learn React from Documentation** repository! 🚀  
This repo is my personal learning journal where I take notes and build small projects while studying **React** directly from the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/). It’s all about learning by doing and understanding the "why" behind the code.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:

- Share with other learners who prefer structured, digestible notes with working code.
